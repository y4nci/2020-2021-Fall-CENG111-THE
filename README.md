# 2020-2021-Fall-CENG111-THE
My solutions for THE2 and THE3 of CENG111 in 2020-2021 Fall Semester.

This repository includes the source codes of THE2 and THE3 and their instructions. 
There is also another file named evaluator.py, which is necessary for the2.py to work properly (see THE2.pdf for more info).
